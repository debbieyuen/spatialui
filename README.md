# Spatial Design and CoreML for the Apple Vision Pro
Spatial user interfaces (UI) and graphics are important components in three-dimensional environments found across many applications including augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), virtual reality (VR), and video games. As spatial computing enters the mainstream through products like the Apple Vision Pro, the design of intuitive, accessible 3D user interfaces (UI) is critical. Creating UI in spatial applications that interact naturally with the physical and
digital worlds requires engineering and design considerations that go beyond traditional 2D interfaces.

Our demonstration prototype, Squiggly, is a visionOS application created with RealityKit and SwiftUI that explores immersive spaces through drawing. Through Apple's Vision Framework, BERT-SQuD, and MNIST we explore how machine learning can be integrated into 3D and 2D user interfaces.
